### Undergraduate Courses

#### STEM 140 – Reason and Abstraction: World of Computing  
**Semesters:**  Fall 2024, Fall 2026  
An introduction to the fundamental ideas of computation, abstraction, and logic. Students explore problem-solving through algorithmic thinking and learn how computing principles connect to real-world applications.

---

#### CSCI 218 – Programming II (Java)  
**Semesters:** Spring 2024, Spring 2025, Spring 2026  
Covers object-oriented programming, data abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces using Java. Students gain hands-on experience with software design, testing, and debugging through practical assignments and projects.

---

#### CSCI 236 – Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Semesters:** Spring 2024, Fall 2025  
Focuses on essential data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimization. Emphasizes algorithmic efficiency, complexity analysis, and implementation in modern programming environments.

---

#### CSCI 226 – Computer Architecture  
**Semesters:** Fall 2023, Fall 2026  
Explores the organization and design of computer systems, from logic gates to CPU architecture. Topics include instruction sets, memory hierarchy, pipelining, and performance analysis.

---

#### CSCI 340 – Databases  
**Semesters:** Fall 2023, Fall 2025  
Introduces database design, relational models, SQL, normalization, and transactions. Students also explore database-driven application development and modern database systems.

---

#### CSCI 345 – Machine Learning  
**Semesters:** Fall 2024 
A hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning. Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and applications of ML algorithms using Python-based toolkits.
