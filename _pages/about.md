Hi! I'm Babafemi, an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.houghton.edu/math-science/computer-science-major/) at [Houghton University](https://www.houghton.edu). My research leverages cutting-edge computer science applications to develop solutions that address real-world challenges in education and healthcare.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in how emerging technologies such as VR, AI, LLMs, and data-driven tools can transform educational experiences, enhance engagement, and expand learning opportunities. My broader research interests include CS Education, Virtual Reality (VR), Digital Health, Gerontechnology, Smart Homes, Machine Learning, and Explainable AI.
