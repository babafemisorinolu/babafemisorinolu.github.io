Waterhouse</strong>, <strong>Pelumi Abimbola</strong>, <strong>Ayodeji Ibitoye</strong>, and myself (<strong>Babafemi G. Sorinolu</strong>), and originated from <strong>Eric’s senior capstone project</strong>, which I had the pleasure of supervising. This work explores the design of a <strong>voice-based assistant</strong> to support <strong>reflective and intentional use of large language models (LLMs) in education</strong>.</p> <p>We traveled to <strong>Saint Martin’s University</strong> for the conference, where <strong>Eric presented the work</strong> on <strong>October 10–11, 2025</strong>. It was inspiring to see a student capstone project showcased in a professional setting.</p> <p>📸 Here’s a snapshot of <strong>Eric</strong> presenting our paper at the conference:<br> <img src="/assets/img/eric_at_ccsc.jpg" alt="Eric presenting at CCSC NW 2025"></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/babafemi_and_eric.jpg" alt="Me and Eric at CCSC NW 2025! 🎉"></p> <p>After the conference, we celebrated by visiting a <strong>Nigerian restaurant</strong> nearby. it was a perfect way to wrap up a successful event and a great trip!<br> 🍽️ <a href="/assets/img/dinner.jpg">View our dinner photo here</a></p> </body></html>
