### 🗣️ Oral Presentation  
**Ashleigh Gossman**, and **Babafemi G. Sorinolu (2024)**  
*“Survey on Trust, Opinions, and Use of ChatGPT.”*  

Ashleigh’s oral presentation explored how students and educators **perceive and trust AI tools like ChatGPT** in academic settings. The study surveyed diverse users to understand patterns in adoption, ethical concerns, and perceptions of reliability, offering valuable insight into how AI technologies are reshaping learning environments.

### 📊 Poster Presentation  
**Isaac Gassparri**, and **Babafemi G. Sorinolu (2024)**  
*“Comparative Analysis of LLMs for Math Education.”*  


Isaac’s poster compared the performance of several **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in solving and explaining mathematical problems. The project analyzed model accuracy, reasoning depth, and pedagogical clarity, contributing to the development of more effective **AI tools for mathematics instruction**.
