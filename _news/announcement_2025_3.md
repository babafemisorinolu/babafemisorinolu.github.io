I am proud to share that our paper, *“Designing for Reflective Learning: A Voice-Based Assistant for Intentional LLM Use in Education,”* was accepted for presentation at the **Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges, Northwestern Conference ([CCSC NW 2025](https://www.ccsc.org/northwest/2025/index.html))**! ✨  
The paper was co-authored by **Eric C. Waterhouse**,  **Pelumi Abimbola**, **Ayodeji Ibitoye**, and myself (**Babafemi G. Sorinolu**), and originated from **Eric’s senior capstone project**, which I had the pleasure of supervising. This work explores the design of a **voice-based assistant** to support **reflective and intentional use of large language models (LLMs) in education**.

We traveled to **Saint Martin’s University** for the conference, where **Eric presented the work** on **October 10–11, 2025**. It was inspiring to see a student capstone project showcased in a professional setting.  

📸 Here’s a snapshot of **Eric** presenting our paper at the conference:
