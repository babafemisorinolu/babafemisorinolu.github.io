I am thrilled to share that **Isaac Anderson** presented our summer research project, *“Augmenting Student Learning with AI and Mixed Reality in Higher Education,”* at the **51st Annual Fall Scientific Paper Session of the Rochester Academy of Science (RAS)**, hosted at **SUNY Geneseo (2025)**!  ✨  📄 [View Program (PDF)](/assets/pdf/51st%20Annual%20Paper%20Session%20Program%20V3.pdf){:target="_blank"}


This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Mixed Reality (MR)** can work together to enhance learning experiences in higher education. Our team developed a **prototype multidisciplinary learning system** that combines:  
1️⃣ a **Mixed Reality (MR)** platform using the **Meta Quest 3** with an **AI-powered tutor** for immersive learning, and  
2️⃣ a **web-based platform** for structured lesson content delivery.  

Together, these tools create a flexible and engaging learning environment, empowering educators to easily design adaptive course materials while providing students with **real-time, personalized AI support**.  

We anticipate that this approach will improve learning outcomes across a variety of disciplines by strengthening both **adaptability** and **independent learner support**. Our next step is to conduct a **usability study** to assess learning experiences and performance across multiple subjects.  

📸 Here’s a snapshot of **Isaac** presenting our work at SUNY Geneseo:
