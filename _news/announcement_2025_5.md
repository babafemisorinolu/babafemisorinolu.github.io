We are conducting a **usability and feedback study** for our **LearnMR VR prototype**, a Virtual Reality application designed to teach **data structures concepts**. The prototype includes an AI-enhanced virtual tablet that provides **supplemental learning support**, but it is *not* the main method of instruction.  
Your participation will help us improve the design, interaction, and educational effectiveness of the prototype.

### What’s involved?
If you agree to participate, you will:
1. Interact with our VR prototype.
2. Complete a short questionnaire about your experience.

The session will take approximately **15–30 minutes**.
